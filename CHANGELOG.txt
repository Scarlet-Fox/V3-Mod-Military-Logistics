V3 Mod - Military Logistics 1.1.0, 2024-01-09
----------------------------------------------------------
- Use government shares to make it basically free to pull things from stockpile (you already paid).
- Remove minting as it's redundant with government shares.
- Added AI Value to single-speed production methods, boosting AI preference a bit.
	- This prevents the AI from thinking that they should build infinite barracks.
	- This also prevents the AI from mindlessly emptying out their stockpile because "money is good".
- Doubled the number of laborers required for the double production method.
- Raised the construction cost of the logistics center to be more in line with other government buildings.
- Taking a state with a logistics center will now provide 25% of the stockpile to you (some materials is lost during the occupation).
- Raised limit on the size of the stockpile (from 3,000 per level to 4,000 per Logistics Center level).
- Lowered the basic paper cost to run a Logistics Center (from 10 to 5 for basic; from 20 to 10 for academic).
- Add input goods (paper, tools) to logistics center production methods (represent maintenance needs of stockpile).
- Fixed a rare bug that prevented stockpiles from being created and resulted in a lot of error messages.
- Known Issue: The AI has more wars due to not being broke. Wars slow the game down. I can't do anything about this.
