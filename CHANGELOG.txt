V3 Mod - Military Logistics 1.1.0 UNRELEASED, 2023-01-03
---------------------------------------------
- Use government shares to make it basically free to pull things from stockpile (you already paid).
- Remove minting as it's redundant with government shares.
- Added AI Value to single-speed production methods, boosting AI preference a bit.
	- This prevents the AI from thinking that they should build infinite barracks.
	- This also prevents the AI from mindlessly emptying out their stockpile because "money is good".
- Doubled the number of laborers required for the double production method.
- Raised the construction cost of the logistics center to be more in line with other government buildings.
- TODO: Add input goods (paper, tools) to logistics center production methods (represent maintenance needs).
- TODO: Add stockpile deterioration over time (need a percentage, which should increase as stockpile gets closer to capacity).
- TODO: Investigate using real goods amounts from logistics center and distribution center buildings.
